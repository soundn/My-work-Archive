## STEPS TO DEPLOY A STATIC WEBSITE ON A UBUNTU SERVER WITH NGINX:

# GET UPDATES
sudo apt update

# INSTALL NGINX  
sudo apt install nginx -y

# CLONE THE CODE FROM GITHUB
git clone https://github.com/GerromeSieger/Static-Site.git

# LOOK AT NGINX CONFIGURATION FILE (Optional)
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# COPY CODE THAT WAS CLONED FROM GITHUB TO WHERE NGINX IS EXPECTING THE STATIC CONTENT
sudo cp -r Static-Site/* /var/www/html
